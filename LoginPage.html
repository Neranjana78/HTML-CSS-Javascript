<h1><marquee>SASTRA DEEMED UNIVERSITY</marquee></h1>
<p>
    SASTRA is committed to excellence with a holistic approach and has consistently maintained the highest standards in "a man-making education" in the immortal words of Swami Vivekananda, which can only be ensured by quality teaching of the finest calibre. We here in SASTRA believe in Tagorean concept of "The Home and the World", keeping in mind, the vital importance of empowering women, by giving them their rightful place in national development.
</p>
<br>

<p>We also believe in the motto 'urbi et orbi' â€“ the city and the world. As the earth is fast becoming a global village with amazing technological advances, transcending national barriers, our educational goals are geared towards nation-building on the one hand and our involvement in the process of globalization on the other.
